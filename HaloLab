    Web design and page structure play a big role in encouraging users to click and
    <br>scroll. But what if there was a blueprint to ensure that every single one of your web
    <br>pages is visitor-friendly? Well, you’re in the right place, as today we’ll break down
    <br>19 essential elements of a successful website and share insider tips on how to
    <br>use them properly.
</p>
<h2>
    Why do you need to think about page structure
</h2>
    <p>
        Let’s start by defining what a webpage is, as it is not the same as a website.
        <br>Simply put, it’s an individual page with specific URLs, different content, and
        <br>unique images, where every element plays a crucial role in engaging the visitor.
        <br>When talking about its structure, we’re addressing how all these pieces fit
        <br>together to make something that’s good to look at and makes sense to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        The organized webpage is the foundation of your online presence. It’s what
        <br>guides your visitors through the content, like invisible signposts pointing to where
        <br>they want to go. Without a well-thought-out structure, even the most visually
        <br>stunning page can leave users lost and confused, resulting in a higher bounce
        <br>rate and lower engagement.
    </p>
<h4>
    A well-structured page leads users smoothly from beginning
    <br>to end.

<h2>
    19 crucial elements of a web page
</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to designing a webpage, it’s all about picking the right elements.
        <br>Interactive pop-ups, hidden buttons, flashy CTAs — these choices determine
        <br>whether a user clicks, keeps browsing, or leaves. But there is much more to
        <br>uncover, and in the following paragraphs, we’ll briefly review 19 must-have
        <br>components that make a webpage both functional and attractive.
    </p>
<h2>
    1. Header
</h2> 
    <p>
        First up is the header or a site menu. Sitting right at the top, it is the primary thing
        <br>anyone sees, no matter which page they land on. This element is strategically
        <br>important, allowing users to jump from one page to the next without hindrance. It
        <br>often includes a logo, main navigation, and sometimes a contact button or social
        <br>media links. 
    </p>
<h4>
    The header is your first chance to make an impression, so
    <br>you’ve got to make it count.
</h4>
<p>
    Your header is a site guide that ensures visitors know exactly where they are and
    <br>how to find what they’re looking for. But here’s the thing — while it might be
    <br>tempting to pack the header with as much information as possible, it’s crucial not
    <br>to overload it. This approach helps in finding the perfect balance between
    <br>providing essential information and maintaining simplicity.

</h4>
<h2>
    2. CTA button
</h2>
    <p>
        Next on the list is the Call to Action (CTA) buttons that guide your visitors on what
        <br>to do next, whether it’s “Buy Now,” “Learn More,” or “Sign Up.” Their main aim is to
        <br>turn a passive user into an active one while improving conversions for a particular
        <br>page.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, it’s not just about slapping a button anywhere. A good CTA subtly stands
        <br>out and doesn’t scream for attention — it’s clear, compelling, and inviting.
        <br>Placement is key, too. Put it in a spot where it’s easy for visitors to find, and check
        <br>out whether it makes sense in the context of your page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember, the CTA button is your chance to convert a casual visitor into a
        <br>customer or subscriber. Though a small element, it packs a powerful punch. Think
        <br>of it as the finishing touch that brings the whole page together and sets the stage
        <br>for your user’s next step.
    </p>

    </p>
<h2>
    3. Hero section
</h2>
<p>
    Moving on, let’s talk about the hero section. Typically found below the header, this
    <br>element is your chance to make an impactful statement. That section usually
    <br>combines an eye-catching image or video with a powerful message and is often
    <br>complemented by a CTA button. Its purpose is to grab attention, deliver a key
    <br>message, and set the tone for the rest of the site.
</p>
<h4>
    Whether you’re showcasing a product, highlighting a service,
    or setting the mood, your hero section should be visually
    striking and emotionally resonant.
</h4>
    <p>
        This component needs to connect with your visitors immediately, telling them
        <br>what your site is about and what they can expect from it. It’s a balancing act — you
        <br>want to be bold, captivating, clear and concise. When done right, the hero section
        <br>can make the user experience better, drawing people in and motivating them to
        <br>explore further.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        A hero section captivates at first glance
    </p>
<h2>
    4. Footer
</h2>
    <p>
        Scrolling down to the bottom of the page, you’ll find the footer. Of course, it might
        <br>not be the first thing visitors see, but it plays a crucial role in wrapping up their
        <br>experience on your site.
    </p>
    <p>
        This section often contains important links, contact information, social media
        <br>icons, and sometimes a brief about the company or a sign-up form for
        <br>newsletters. It’s a place where visitors can find various resources and information
        <br>that didn’t quite fit in the main navigation in header or elsewhere on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the last impression you leave on your visitors, so make it a good one,
        <br>reflecting the professionalism and comprehensiveness of your site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Structured info in a footer does not overload the user
    </p>

    <br>using footers in our feature article on Website Footer
    <br>Design.
</h4>
<h2>
    5. Slider
</h2>
    <p>
        Up next is the slider. This element uses the technique of a slideshow or carousel
        <br>and is the dynamic storyteller of your webpage that rotates a series of images,
        <br>text, or videos across the screen. It showcases multiple pieces of content and
        <br>thus saves space on your layout.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether it’s the latest offers, featured products, or key messages, the slider lets
        <br>you present content in an engaging, easily digestible format. As a result, your
        <br>visitors feel excited after an interactive experience while the metrics of their time
        <br>spent on the site grow.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        Compactly presented media via slider saves space on a page
    </p>
<h2>
    6. Search
</h2>
    <p>
        Another useful component is a search function tucked away in the header or an
        <br>easily accessible place. With this element, visitors have a quick way to find what
        <br>they’re looking for. It simplifies browsing content within a website and displays
        <br>relevant information based on the search query.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether your site is packed with loads of media or a wide range of products,
        <br>a search field helps cut through the clutter. This is a handy tool for e-commerce
        <br>sites or content-heavy platforms where navigating through pages and categories
        <br>can get overwhelming.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        A search field greatly improves website navigation
    </p>

<h2>
    7. Menu and navigation
</h2>
    <p>
        When we think about easy navigation across a webpage, the menu is the main
        <br>element that comes to mind. This component guides visitors through the site to
        <br>help them understand what you offer at a glance and how to get there.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are various menu types to choose from, each serving different design
        <br>needs and user experiences. The classic horizontal menu runs across the top of
        <br>your page, offering straightforward access to major sections. Then, there’s the
        <br>sidebar menu, tucked to the side, perfect for sites with extensive navigation.
        <br>Dropdown menus reveal additional options under each main category, while
        <br>drop-up menus work similarly but open upwards.
    </p>
    <p>
        For sites with a wide range of topics or products, the mega menu provides a
        <br>comprehensive view of all options in one large panel. And let’s not forget the
        <br>hamburger menu, a space-saving icon that expands to reveal navigation links.
        <br>Each type has its advantages, and the choice largely depends on the layout and
        <br>content of your webpage.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        An interactive menu visually attracts the user
    </p>
<h2>
    8. Breadcrumbs
</h2>
    <p>
        Next in line is breadcrumbs. No, we’re not talking about the kind you find in the
        <br>kitchen, but the digital steps that help guide visitors through your website. It is
        <br>important to note that they don’t replace the primary menu we discussed earlier
        <br>but instead present a second level of navigation and streamline the platform’s
        <br>usability.
    </p>
<h4>
    The success is in the details, and nowhere is this truer than in the world of web design.
</h4>
    <p>
        Typically appearing at the top of a page, this navigational feature shows users
        <br>their current location on your site and how they got there. It leaves behind a digital
        <br>footprint to help users backtrack or navigate to other sections without having to
        <br>hit the “back” button multiple times.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        Breadcrumbs are a visual guide for users
    </p>
<h2>
    9. Forms
</h2>
    <p>
        Whether it’s for signing up for a newsletter, making a purchase, or getting in
        <br>touch, forms are the go-to method for visitors to interact and communicate with
        <br>your site. They are essential to gather information, simplify transactions, or
        <br>get feedback. This element encourages users to send information to the system or
        <br>server while allowing you to build up a customer base.
    </p>
    <p>
        It should ask for only the necessary information, making the process quick and
        <br>hassle-free. Think about the forms you’ve enjoyed filling out — they probably had
        <br>clear labels, were easy to navigate, and didn’t ask for your life story. That’s what
        <br>you must aim for. Place forms in an accessible way, making them intuitive, with a
        <br>clear call to action, like “Submit,” “Send,” or “Sign Up.”
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        A form improves interactions between your website and its users 
    </p>
<h2>
    10. Cards
</h2>
    <p>
        Move on to the next element — cards. Each section typically contains an image or
        <br>icon, a brief description, and perhaps a call to action, all enclosed in a small,
        <br>defined area. From products and blog posts to user profiles and more, cards
        <br>organize a chunk of content types in a compact, visually appealing package. The
        <br>beauty of using these components lies in their simplicity and clarity. They allow
        <br>users to quickly scan for information, making the browsing experience more
        <br>efficient and enjoyable.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        A card system visually improves the content structure 
    </p>

    <br>and tips showcased in the Card UI Design article.
</h4>
<h2>
    11. Videos
</h2>
    <p>
        <br>Media materials are a big deal. When was the last time you scrolled past a video
        <br>without at least a curious glance? They draw us in, keep us hooked, and
        <br>sometimes, before we know it, we’ve learned something new or found a product
        <br>we can’t live without.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, why not harness the power of video on your website? Use it to show off your
        <br>products, give a sneak peek into your services, or share some client testimonials.
        <br>But while videos are great, they’ve got to be good. No one wants to sit through a
        <br>grainy, hard-to-hear, or boring video. Your visitors are there for a reason, and
        <br>videos should reflect that.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        Videos make users stay on a website longer
    </p>
<h2>
    12. Progress indicator
</h2>
    <p>
        Have you ever filled out a form or completed a task online and wondered, “How
        <br>much longer is this going to take?” That’s where a progress indicator comes in
        <br>handy. This small but helpful element gives users a visual cue of where they are in
        <br>the process and how much is left. It is especially useful for multi-step processes
        <br>like online shopping checkouts, surveys, or registration forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Think of it as the digital equivalent of breadcrumbs leading to the finish line. It can
        <br>be as simple as a series of dots, a numbered list, or a bar that fills up as you move
        <br>forward. Whatever style you choose, make sure it’s clear and consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
        But why stop at just being functional? Get creative with it! Use colors, animations,
        <br>or even fun little messages that pop up as the user progresses. This makes the
        <br>experience more engaging and can also reflect your brand’s personality.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        Progress indicator let users know at what stage they are now
    </p>
<h2>
    13. Favicon
</h2>
    <p>
        There is another small yet mighty tool — favicon. That is a tiny icon in your browser
        <br>tab next to a website’s name. It might seem insignificant, but it’s actually a little
        <br>powerhouse in the world of web design that allows users to get a quick visual
        <br>connection with your brand while they are browsing.
    </p>
    <p>
        A favicon is your website’s mini calling card that makes a big impression. When a
        <br>user has dozens of tabs open (and let’s be honest, who doesn’t?), your favicon is
        <br>what helps your website stand out in that crowded sea. It’s a subtle and effective
        <br>way to keep your brand visible and recognizable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Creating a favicon is not just about shrinking your logo into a tiny square. It needs
        <br>to be clear, identifiable, and reflective of your brand’s identity. The best favicons
        <br>are simple, bold, and use limited color palettes. Remember, it must be
        <br>recognizable even at a glance and on a small scale.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        A memorable favicon improves brand awareness
    </p>
<h2>
    14. Tags
</h2>
    <p>
        Another versatile element on your webpage is tags. They’re like those sticky notes
        <br>you put on documents to remind you what’s what. On a website, they help
        <br>categorize content, making it a breeze for users to find what they’re interested in.
        <br>Say you’re running a blog. In that case, tags help your visitors quickly click through
        <br>to related topics they’re curious about.
    </p>
    <p>
        They’re also a big win for SEO. Search engines love well-organized content, and
        <br>tags are a straightforward way to keep things neat and tidy. Plus, they give users a
        <br>peek into what your content is all about. But here’s the key — don’t go overboard.
        <br>Have you ever felt overwhelmed by a bunch of random sticky notes slapped
        <br>everywhere? It’s the same with tags. Keep them relevant, specific, and to the
        <br>point.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        Strategically placed tags enhance website usability
    </p>
<h2>
    15. Links
</h2>
    <p>
        <br>Links are your way of guiding visitors around your site and even beyond it.
        <br>Whether it’s internal URLs that keep customers exploring your site or external
        <br>ones that offer additional information, each is a helpful signpost. The main idea is
        <br>to make it clear and purposeful.
    </p>
    <p>
        You probably clicked on a link, thinking it would take you somewhere, and ended
        <br>up in a completely unexpected place. Frustrating, right? That’s why your links
        <br>should always be descriptive and give a good idea of where they lead. And let’s
        <br>not forget about making them stand out. They have to be visible but not so flashy
        <br>that they disrupt the flow of your content.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        Easy-to-spot links are more likely to be clicked on
    </p>
<h2>
    16. Quality images
</h2>
    <p>
        Let’s shine a spotlight on quality images. They speak volumes without saying a
        <br>word, set the tone, evoke emotions, and connect with your audience on a deeper
        <br>level. Such an essential element can showcase your products, share moments,
        <br>and tell the brand’s story.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check whether each image is in line with your identity, as the wrong visuals can
        <br>lead to confusion among users. Additionally, be mindful of image size and loading
        <br>speed. Nobody would care for even the most beautiful picture if it takes forever to
        <br>load, and keeping the balance in that case is key.
    </p>

    <br>Resizing Halo Lab plugin in the article How to Optimize
    <br>Images.
</h4>
    <p>
        And remember, diversity and authenticity in your imagery can make your website
        <br>feel more inclusive and relatable. It’s about showing real people, real emotions,
        <br>and real scenarios. Stock photos can be handy, but they must be chosen carefully
        <br>to avoid that staged, generic look.
    </p>

    <img src="" alt="">

    <p>
        Quality images should tie in with your brand message 
    </p>
<h2>
    17. Typography
</h2>
    <p>
        We’re close to the finish line, and the next element is typography. First up, font
        <br>choice. This can be a fun playground but also a tricky field. Whenever you are
        <br>sleek and modern or quirky and whimsical, select the best font that reflects your
        <br>brand’s personality. Moreover, avoid using too many different ones. Stick to a few
        <br>that complement each other and keep it consistent across your website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then there’s readability. Think about font size, color contrast, and spacing to make
        <br>text readable. Also, consider the mood your typography sets, as different fonts
        <br>evoke different feelings. A serif font might feel traditional and trustworthy, while a
        <br>sans-serif could be seen as clean and modern.
    </p>

    <br>serif font examples to improve your branding and website
    <br>design in 2024.”
</h4>
    <p>
        And let’s not forget about special fonts for headings and accents — they’re like the
        <br>highlighters of your text, drawing attention to key areas.

<h2>
    18. White space
</h2>
    <p>
        Time to talk about <a href="">white space</a>, often the invisible element of great web design.
        <br>And while it might seem like “empty” space, it’s anything but. It gives users
        <br>a break, helps them process information, and guides them from one element to
        <br>another.
    </p>
    <p>
        It doesn’t necessarily have to be white, by the way. It’s all about the unmarked
        <br>space, regardless of color or background. This is the area between graphics,
        <br>margins, gutters, fields between columns, and even the place between lines of
        <br>text.
    </p>
    <p>
        And balance is critical. Too little white space can turn your site into a cramped
        <br>one, but too much might make it seem empty or unfinished. Try to find that sweet
        <br>spot where design elements and white space complement one another
        <br>harmoniously.
    </p>

        Strategically used white space complements a site’s aesthetic

<h2>
    19. Sidebar
</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, a sidebar is a trusty sidekick to your website’s main content with extra
        <br>information or functionality. It can house anything from navigation menus, social
        <br>media links, and author bios to call-to-action buttons like share, search bars, and
        <br>upcoming events. Typically, it sticks to the left or right side of a web page and
        <br>presents a vertical list of options.
    </p>
<h4>
    A well-crafted sidebar is like a helpful guide, always offering
    <br>something more.
</h4>
    <p>
        A well-designed sidebar should be a natural extension of a website tailored to fit
        <br>the content of your page. For example, a search bar might be included within a
        <br>blog post, recent posts, or tags. On a product page, it may show related items or
        <br>customer reviews. The key is relevance. Your sidebar should always offer
        <br>something valuable and pertinent to the visitor’s current interest.
    </p>

<h2>
    Final point
</h2>
    <p>
        And there we have it — a comprehensive journey through the essential elements
        <br>of a webpage, from top to bottom. We’ve explored how each component,
        <br>including favicons, breadcrumbs, videos, cards, and many more, shapes an
        <br>identity for a cohesive and user-friendly website. And most importantly, how to
        <br>implement them correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, as you begin your web design journey, keep these elements in mind. Use
        <br>them wisely, blend them creatively, and watch your website transform into a
        <br>vibrant, living entity that connects with your audience and stands out in the digital
        <br>world. If you’d like to leave this responsibility entirely to a design team, Halo Lab is
        <br>happy to help. For more detailed information, contact us at any time!
