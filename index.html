    <p>
        Confused by website terminology?
    </p>
    <p>
        If so, here’s a handy glossary (all in plain English) that’ll quickly get you up to speed and
        <br>demystify the language of web technology.
    </p>
        Once you understand basic website jargon, you’ll never get intimidated or befuddled the next
        <br>time a web designer or web developer spews techno-babble.
    </p>
    <h1>
        Basic Anatomy Of A Website
    </h1>
    <p>
        Let’s start by defining the various parts of a website:
    </p>
    <h2>
        Header
    </h2>
    <p>
        The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually find the logo and the site’s
        <br>navigation menu. It’s that steady, reliable part of the page that stays visible no matter where
        <br>visitors click on your site.
    </p>
    <p>
        Years ago, headers often featured big banners or graphics to promote a brand—similar to the
        <br>cover photo on a Facebook page. But these days, the trend is to keep things simple, with just a 
        <br>logo, navigation, and possibly a call-to-action button to keep your website looking clean and
        <br>modern.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Pre-Header
    </h2>
    <p>
        The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header. It’s often used to display helpful
        <br>information like your contact details, business hours, special offers, or even secondary
        <br>navigation links. Think of it as a small but mighty space for quick-access details that your visitors
        <br>might appreciate seeing right away.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Favicon
    </h2>
    <p>
        A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to your website title. It’s usually a
        <br>simplified version of your logo or brand mark. Favicons help visitors quickly identify your website
        <br>when they have multiple tabs open, and they add a polished, professional look to your site.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Navigation (aka Navigation Bar or Main Menu)
    </h2>
    <p>
        The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website that helps visitors find what they’re
        <br>looking for. These links are usually part of the header or located just below it.
    </p>
    <p>
        On mobile devices, navigation links often transform into an icon with three stacked lines—
        <br>commonly called a “hamburger” menu because it resembles a side view of a hamburger. Tapping
        <br>this icon reveals a vertical toggle or horizontal flyout menu, making it easy to browse even on
        <br>smaller screens.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more complex websites with tons of pages, you might encounter a “mega menu.” This is a
        <br>dropdown menu that appears when you hover over or click a link in the main navigation. It
        <br>displays multiple categories and subcategories, neatly organizing many links—kind of like a
        <br>visual sitemap.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Breadcrumbs
    </h2>
    <p>
        Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location within a website’s
        <br>hierarchy. They usually appear near the top of the page and look something like this:
    </p>
    <p>
        Home > Blog > Latest Posts > Post Title
    </p>
    <p>
        Breadcrumbs make it easy for visitors to understand where they are on your site and quickly
        <br>backtrack to previous pages. They’re especially helpful for larger websites with lots of categories
        <br>and subpages.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Website Content
    </h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website
        <br>content goes beyond just words. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Website content is everything on your site that communicates your message to visitors. It
        <br>includes all the elements people interact with—text, images, videos, audio, and more. It’s the full
        <br>collection of materials designed to inform, engage, or persuade your audience—the whole
        <br>package, or as some might say, the whole shebang. 
    </p>
    <h2>
        Homepage (or home page)
    </h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="">homepage</a> — also called the front page or main page — is the starting point of most
        <br>websites. It’s often the first page visitors see and serves as a central hub to guide them through
        <br>your site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The homepage sets the tone for the entire website, giving visitors a quick sense of who you are,
        <br>what you do, and where they should go next. It’s like the front door to your business online.
    </p>
    <p>
        Common elements on a home page include:
    </p>
    <p>
        &check;A hero area (headline and image) to grab attention.
        <br>&check;A navigation menu to help visitors find key pages.
        <br>&check;Links or sections highlighting your most important content, services, or calls to action.
    </p>
    <p>
        A common website design best practice is to link your logo to the home page. This gives visitors
        <br>an easy “escape” or “reset” if they ever get lost while navigating your site.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Homepage Hero Area (aka Feature Area aka Headline Area)
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Homepage Hero Area is the top section of a homepage that grabs your attention and
        <br>introduces the site’s primary message. It often spans the full width of the page and typically 
        <br>includes key elements like:
    </p>
    <p>
        &check;A headline that clearly communicates the site’s purpose or the problem it solves.
        <br>&check;A sub-headline that adds supporting details or context.
        <br>&check;A call-to-action button to encourage visitors to take their next step, such as scheduling a consultation or exploring services.
        <br>&check;A visual element, such as an image, graphic, or video, that enhances the message and creates visual interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        The term “hero” comes from traditional print media, where it referred to the main headline and
        <br>image meant to grab attention. In web design, the hero area serves a similar purpose: to create
        <br>an immediate and lasting impression.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Slider
    </h2>
    <p>
        A slider is a feature on a website that displays a rotating series of images, like a slideshow. The
        <br>images usually slide horizontally from one to the next, though some sliders use fade effects
        <br>instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        You’ll most often find sliders on homepages, either as a replacement for a hero image or as an
        <br>additional design element.
    </p>
    <p>
        While sliders used to be a common design trend, their popularity has decreased in recent years.
        <br>because they can slow down your site’s load time and don’t always offer the best experience for
        <br>mobile users. Although sliders can add some visual interest, sliders are often more decorative
        <br>than practical.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Website Content
    </h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to written text, you’ll often hear it called web copy or body copy, but website
        <br>content goes beyond just words. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Website content is everything on your site that communicates your message to visitors. It
        <br>includes all the elements people interact with—text, images, videos, audio, and more. It’s the full
        <br>collection of materials designed to inform, engage, or persuade your audience—the whole
        <br>package, or as some might say, the whole shebang.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Alt Text
    </h2>
    <p>
        Alt text (short for “alternative text”) is a brief description added to images on a website. It serves
        <br>two main purposes:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>It makes websites more accessible by describing images to visually impaired users who rely
                <br>on screen readers.</li>
            <li>
                It helps search engines understand what an image is about, which can improve your
                <br>website’s SEO.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you have an image of an office space, instead of leaving it without a description,
        <br>you might add alt text like: “Photo of a modern office space with large windows and desks.”
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sidebar
    </h2>
    <p>
        <br>A sidebar is the narrow vertical column that appears alongside your main website content. It’s
        <br>often used to display things like advertisements, links to other content, calls to action, or a
        <br>search box. Think of it as a supporting area for secondary information that complements the
        <br>primary content.
    </p>
    <p>
        In recent years, many websites have moved away from using sidebars altogether, opting instead
        <br>for a single, full-width layout. For some websites, removing the sidebar makes sense; for others,
        <br>it doesn’t. The decision really comes down to personal preference, the user experience you want
        <br>to create, and which layout (sidebar vs. no sidebar) works better for your goals—like improving
        <br>readability or increasing conversions.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sub-Footer
    </h2>
    <p>
        The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a webpage—just above the main
        <br>footer—and is consistent across your site. Think of it as a secondary navigation bar that provides
        <br>additional points of access or contact details once visitors have scrolled through the primary
        <br>content. While its content varies by site, a sub-footer typically includes elements such as:
    </p>
    <p>
        <h5>&check;Quick Contact Information:</h5>Displaying addresses or phone numbers for immediate reference.
        <h5>&check;Supplementary Navigation Links:</h5>Offering shortcuts to key pages like “About Us,” “Services,” or even “Our Locations.”
        <h5>&check;Social Media Icons:</h5>Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles. Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles.
        <h5>&check;Additional Resources:</h5>This might include links to site maps or ancillary informational pages.
    </p>
    <p>
        The sub-footer is designed to serve as an added layer of user convenience, enriching the overall
        <br>navigation experience without being as formal as the main footer.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Footer (The "True" Footer)
    </h2>
    <p>
        The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a webpage. It typically contains
        <br>essential legal, informational, and administrative details that are less frequently updated but are
        <br>critical for compliance and user trust. Common footer contents include:
    </p>
        &checkmark;Copyright and Legal Disclaimers:
        <p>
            Noting trademark rights and the copyright year.
        </p>
        &check;Policy Links:
            <p>
                Links to the privacy policy, terms of use, and any other legal information.
            </p>
        &check;Site Map:
        <p>
            A detailed breakdown of the website’s structure for improved navigation and SEO.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section is static across the entire site and represents the definitive end point of your
            <p>
                webpage content.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Note: 
            </h3>
            <p>
                Although many people refer to both areas (i.e. sub-footer and footer) as the “footer,”
                <br>they're actually two different things. The sub-footer typically contains secondary navigation and
                <br>quick-access details, whereas the "true" footer is reserved for legal and administrative
                <br>information.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Landing Page
            </h2>
            <p>
                A landing page is a specific page on your website where visitors “land” after clicking on an ad—
                <br>whether it’s from Google, Facebook, or anywhere else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Landing pages are designed differently than regular website pages. Distractions like headers,
                <br>footers, and sidebars are often removed or minimized to keep visitors focused.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main goal of a landing page is to get the visitor to take a specific action—like downloading a
                <br>report, signing up for an email list, or making a purchase. To maximize conversions, the content
                <br>on a landing page is laser-focused, guiding visitors toward that single objective.
            </p>
            Here's a <a href="">landing page example.</a>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Call To Action (aka CTA)
        </h2>
        <p>
            A call to action (or CTA) is a specific and direct request asking visitors to take a desired action.
            <br>CTAs can take many forms: buttons, popups, ribbons, slide-ins, email opt-in boxes, or even a
            <br>simple text link.
        </p>
        <p>
            A good call to action doesn’t have to be pushy or over-the-top. Sometimes a simple “click here” or
            <br>“learn more” works perfectly. The key is to gently nudge your visitors toward the next step you
            <br>want them to take—whether that’s signing up, making a purchase, or contacting you.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Above the Fold
        </h2>
        <p>
            “Above the fold” refers to the part of a webpage you immediately see before you start scrolling.
            <br>Placing your call-to-action (CTA) above the fold ensures visitors see it right away, increasing the
            <br>likelihood they’ll take action—like clicking a button or filling out a form.
        </p>
        <p>
            The term “above the fold” comes from the newspaper industry, where the most important
            <br>headlines and images were placed on the top half of a folded newspaper to grab readers’
            <br>attention with a quick glance — like when they walk past a newsstand.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Blog
        </h2>
        <p>
            A blog is a type of website—or a section of a larger website—that features content published as
            <br>individual posts in chronological order, like journal entries in a diary.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what’s the difference between a blog and a standard website? It comes down to how the
            <br>content is structured and presented:
        </p>
        <p>
            &check;Blog posts are organized chronologically, often allowing for reader interactivity through
            <br>comments.
            <br>&check;Web pages (like the homepage, about page, or contact page) are static, not time-based, and
            <br>don’t typically include comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blogs also tend to have a more casual, conversational tone compared to standard web pages,
            <br>which are usually more formal and informational, focusing on products, services, or company
            <br>details.
        </p>
        <p>
            A blog can stand alone as its own website, or it can live as a section within a larger website—just
            <br>like this blog post you’re reading right now.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Card Design (aka Tile Design or Grid-Based Design)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Card design organizes content into visually distinct “cards” or tiles, often arranged in a grid
            <br>layout. Popularized by sites like Pinterest, this design style is clean, easy to scan, and works well
            <br>on both desktop and mobile devices.
            <p>
                Card design can be used in a variety of ways:
            </p>
            &check;<b>Image galleries</b>
            <br>&check;<b>Blog pages</b> to showcase multiple posts 
            <br>&check;<b>Sales pages</b> to highlight features, benefits, or services   
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s a flexible, visually appealing way to present information. With a little creativity,
            <br>the possibilities are endless.

            Additional Terminology Of Modern Websites
        </h1>
        <h2>
            WordPress
        </h2>
        <p>
            WordPress powers <a href="">millions of websites</a>worldwide and is one of the most popular tools for
            <br>building and managing websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of WordPress as the operating system for your website—similar to how Windows runs on a
            <br>PC, macOS on a MacBook, or iOS on an iPhone. It’s a content management system (CMS) that
            <br>allows you to easily add, remove, or update content without needing advanced technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here’s how WordPress works:
        </p>
        
        <li><b>Themes</b>
            A WordPress theme controls how your site looks. It’s what transforms WordPress
            <br>into a functional website. There are thousands of themes—some free, some paid—and
            <br>most can be customized to match your company’s brand. Using a theme is far faster (and
            <br>cheaper) than building a website entirely from scratch, like we had to do back in the early
            <br>2000s.
        </li>
        <li><b>Plugins</b>
            Plugins add functionality to your site, much like apps on your phone. With tens
            <br>of thousands of WordPress plugins available, you can add features like contact forms, image
            <br>galleries, site security, shopping carts—pretty much anything you can imagine.
        </li>
        <p>
            Thanks to themes and plugins, WordPress makes it possible to build a custom, high-quality
            <br>website for a fraction of what it used to cost.
        </p>
        <h2>
            WordPress Page vs. WordPress Post
        </h2>
        <p>
            This takes a bit of explaining, so I wrote a whole piece on the similarities and differences
            <br>between WordPress pages and posts, which you can find <a href="">here</a>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Hosting
        </h2>
        <p>
            To have a website on the internet, it needs to be <b> hosted </b> on a web server. Think of hosting as the
            <br>piece of land where your website “lives.” Just like you need land to build a house, you need a
            <br>server to store your website’s files and make them available to people on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are plenty of companies that offer website hosting services, like <a href="">HostGator</a> or <a href="">BlueHost</a>,
            <br>which rent out space on their servers so your site can be available online 24/7.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Caching
        </h2>

            Caching is the process of storing a temporary version of a website or webpage to help it <b>load
            <br>faster.</b>When someone visits your website, a cached version can be delivered quickly instead of
            <br>forcing the browser to fetch everything from scratch.
        </p>
        <p>
            Caching improves site speed, reduces the load on your web server, and makes for a smoother
            <br>experience for visitors—especially for those who come back to your site repeatedly.

        <h2>
            Domain Name (aka URL)
        </h2>
        <p>
            A domain name is the address people type into their browser to visit a website—like
            <br>Amazon.com, CNN.com, or markbrinker.com.
        </p>
        <p>
            Behind the scenes, every website is identified by an IP address, which is a long string of numbers
            <br>like 143.398.884.342. But let’s be honest—who can remember all those digits? That’s why domain
            <br>names exist: they’re easier to remember and use words instead of numbers to identify a website.
        </p>
        <b>Fun fact:</b>The term URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator — it’s the technical name for a web 
        <br>address.
        <h2>
            Domain Registrar
        </h2>
        <p>
            A domain registrar is where you purchase and register your domain name—kind of like getting a
            <br>license plate for your car from the DMV.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are plenty of domain registrars online, such as <a href=""> NameCheap.com </a> or GoDaddy. Once you
            <br>register your domain name, it’s officially yours (as long as you keep renewing it).
        </p>
        <h2>
            301 Redirect
        </h2>
        <p>
            A 301 redirect is a way to permanently send visitors (and search engines) from one URL to
            <br>another. It’s often used when you update your website’s structure, change a page’s URL, or move
            <br>your site to a new domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you change a page’s URL from yourwebsite.com/ <b>services</b> to
            <br>yourwebsite.com/ <b>our-services</b>, a 301 redirect ensures anyone visiting the old link will
            <br>automatically land on the new page. It also tells search engines to pass along any SEO value
            <br>from the old URL to the new one.
        </p>
        <h2>
            404 Error Page
        </h2>
        <p>
            A 404 error page appears when someone tries to visit a page on your website that doesn’t exist
            <br>— either because the page was deleted, the URL was mistyped, or the link is broken.
        </p>
        While a default 404 page simply tells visitors the page can’t be found, a well-designed 404 page
        <br>can do more. It can include helpful links, a search bar, or even a friendly message to guide
        <br>visitors back to where they want to go, instead of leaving them frustrated.
        <h2>
            DNS
        </h2>
        <p>
            DNS stands for <a href="">Domain Name System</a>. Think of it as the phone book of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, humans use domain names (like markbrinker.com) instead of long, hard-
            <br>to-remember IP addresses. When you type a domain name into your web browser, your internet
            <br>service provider (ISP) connects to a <b>domain name server</b>—one of many located around the
            <br>world. The DNS server quickly looks up the IP address linked to that domain name and routes
            <br>you to the website you requested.
        </p>
        <b>resume here</b>
        <h2>
            HTML
        </h2>
        <p>
            HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and it’s the standard language used to create
            websites and web pages. Invented in 1991 by <a href="">Tim Berners-Lee</a> (the creator of the World Wide
            Web), HTML allows developers to structure content on a webpage using tags for elements like
            headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Fun fact: </b>
            HTML inspired the name of the original Hotmail email service, launched in 1996. The
            <br>founders cleverly included “HTML” in the name to highlight the web-based nature of their email
            <br>platform.
        </p>
        <h2>
            CSS
        </h2>
        <p>
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. While HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage,
            <br>CSS is what makes it <b>look good</b>. It controls the design—things like fonts, colors, spacing, and
            <br>layout.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS also determines how a website appears on different devices, ensuring it looks great whether
            <br>you’re viewing it on a desktop, tablet, or phone.
        </p>
        A <b>website builder</b> is an all-in-one tool that allows you to design and build a website without
        <br>needing to write code. Website builders typically feature drag-and-drop editors, making them
        <br>easy to use, even for those with minimal technical experience.
        <p>
            Popular examples of website builders include Wix and Squarespace. These platforms simplify the
            <br>entire process by bundling everything you need—like hosting, design, and domain management
            <br>—into one system.
            <p>
                A <b>page builder</b>, on the other hand, is slightly different. Page builders are tools (often plugins)
                <br>that allow you to create and customize individual pages on platforms like WordPress. For
                <br>example, tools like <a href="">Elementor</a> and <a href="">Thrive Architect</a> are WordPress page builders that let you
                <br>design pages with a drag-and-drop editor, while still leveraging the flexibility of WordPress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Website builders are great for quickly getting a website up and running because they limit
                complexity. However, they can lack the customization and scalability of page builders on open
                platforms like WordPress.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Note</b>: While drag-and-drop tools are a game changer, you’ll still need a basic understanding of
                <br>HTML and CSS for fine-tuning your website. Sorry to rain on the parade. 😮
            </p>
            <h2>
                Mobile Responsive
            </h2>
            <p>
                A mobile responsive website automatically morphs to fit the shape and size of the screen it’s
                <br>being viewed on—whether that’s a phone, tablet, or desktop. It uses CSS to adjust the layout,
                <br>navigation, and font sizes seamlessly, so the site is easy to use and read on any device.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="">More than 50%</a> of all web traffic comes from mobile devices, so mobile responsive design has
                <br>become the standard for modern websites. If you have to pinch and zoom to make text
                <br>readable, that’s a sure sign the website is not mobile friendly.
            </p>
            <h2>
                SSL
            </h2>
            <p>
                SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer. An SSL certificate encrypts the data sent between a website’s
                <br>server and your browser, ensuring that hackers can’t intercept or read it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can tell if a website is secure by looking for the padlock icon in your browser’s address bar:
            </p>
            <li>A <b>non-secure</b> website starts with <b>non-secure</b> (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).</li>
            <li>A <b>secure</b> website starts with <b>“https”</b>, where the “s” stands for <b>secure</b>.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            SSL certificates have become standard for <b>all websites</b>, even those that don’t collect sensitive
            <br>information like contact details or payment data. Visitors expect to see the SSL padlock icon, and
            <br>web browsers often flag non-SSL websites with warnings that can make users feel nervous or
            <br>unsafe.
        </p>
        <h2>
            SEO
        </h2>
        <p>
            SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. It’s the process of configuring your website to get
            <br>free traffic from search engine results pages (often referred to as SERPs).
        </p>
        <p>
            SEO can seem like a large and complex topic—and it is—but at its core, it’s about creating
            <br>content that search engines value and people actually want. To get ranked in the organic search
            <br>listings, you need to produce content that:
        </p>
            <li>Is high quality and genuinely helpful.</li>
            <li>People actually want to read, share, or link to.</li>
            <li>Is properly formatted on your site (known as On-Page SEO).</li>
        <p>
            That said, there’s a lot of confusion and wildly unrealistic expectations around SEO. It’s important
            <br>to know that SEO takes time, effort, and strategy to be effective.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Google Analytics
        </h2>
        <p>
            <a href="">Google Analytics</a> is a free service from Google that provides statistics about your website—like
            <br>how many visitors you’re getting, which pages they’re viewing, and how long they’re spending on
            <br>each page.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use Google Analytics, all you need to do is install a small tracking script on your website, and
            <br>you’re good to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            By collecting this data, Google Analytics removes the guesswork and helps you see what’s
            <br>working on your website andwhat isn’t.

            <h2>
                Email Service Provider (ESP)
            </h2>
            <p>
                An <b>email service provider</b> (sometimes called an email management service or EMS) helps you
                <br>build, manage, and communicate with your list of email subscribers.
            </p>
            Popular examples of email service providers include MailChimp, Aweber (which we use),
            <br>Constant Contact, ConvertKit, GetResponse, and ActiveCampaign.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using an email service provider offers several key benefits:
        </p>
        <li>
            <b>
                Automation:
            </b> 
                Users can add or remove themselves from your list automatically. You can
            <br>
                also set up emails to send based on specific user actions (e.g., signing up for your list).
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Scalability: 
            </b>
                Send a single broadcast email to hundreds or thousands of subscribers with
            <br>
                just a click—something that’s nearly impossible to do manually.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Deliverability:
            </b>
                Email service providers are “whitelisted,” so your messages are less likely to
            <br>
                be flagged as spam. If you try sending too many emails in quick succession with tools like
            <br>
                Outlook or Gmail, your ISP might block them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>
                Compliance: 
            </b>
                Helps you stay compliant with email regulations like the <a href="">CAN-SPAM Act</a> to avoid 
            <br>
                penalties.

            Conclusion
        </h2>
        <p>
            I hope you found this mini crash course on website terminology helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            The good news? You don’t need to understand all the tech behind the scenes to have productive
            <br>conversations with a web designer or developer. A basic grasp of these terms is more than
            <br>enough to help you feel confident and informed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’ll be updating this glossary over time, so if there’s a term I missed or one you think should be
